                We are Richard Guerre and Ishmam Mahmud, two students at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology studying in Computer Engineering (CS + ELEC). 
                <br></br><br></br> We made this as we found it hard to make a collaborative playlist on Spotify and even harder to have one with a voting system integrated.
